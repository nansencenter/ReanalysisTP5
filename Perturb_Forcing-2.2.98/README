Routines described in this README:

force_perturb-2.2    - perturb existing forcing fields  with random forcing
------------------
In this directory is the routine force_perturb-2.2. This routine simply 
adds time-dependent perturbations on existing forcing files. it reads
infile2.in to get variances  of  random forcing ++, and applies them to
existing forcing fields. Results are put in files with names a la 
tst.forcing.airtmp.[ab]

MODEL.CPP works for choosing the implemenation in TP4/TP5 model

Revision history:
c> May 2019 - The call method was inherited from forfun_nersc
c> Oct 2019 - Tick off the net heatflux from ECMWF because they are not used by HYCOM_CICE
c> May 2023 - Replace the perturabation strategies for shwflx/radflx by the same way for precipitation
c> Nov 2024 - Modify the windfac into 2-D dependent on the grid size and remove a possible bug due to implementing into TP4 and TP5 in which the air pressuure takes different unit.
